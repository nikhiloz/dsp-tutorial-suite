# FFT DSP Toolkit

A lightweight educational toolkit for learning and experimenting with Digital Signal Processing (DSP) concepts, focused on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) implementations.

## Features
- 📂 Clean repo structure (`src/`, `include/`, `examples/`, `tests/`, `docs/`)
- ⚡ Starter FFT and FIR filter implementations in C
- 🧪 Unit tests for reproducibility
- 📖 Notes and references from classic DSP textbooks (Haykin, Proakis, Oppenheim & Schafer)
- 🔧 Makefile for easy builds on Linux/Raspberry Pi

## Getting Started
```bash
make
./build/fft_demo
./build/filter_demo
